# Hello world in Go(lang)

This is my first Hello World program in Go.

# Motivation

Over the past few months, I have heard a few good things about Go although I didn't really have a reason to get myself to learn it as I was busy working on other projects.

Last week, I co-incidentally met [@shurcooL](https://github.com/shurcool/), who was kind enough to talk to me about his experience working with Go and also answered some of the questions I had about learning new languages and such. After speaking with him, I decided to give Go a shot.

# Getting Started

Go has really concise and well written documentation. Here is a great link to setting up and writing your first Hello World program in Go.

# Future work

I plan to build a backend API for my iOS app (Trump Or False) in Go. It is currently written in rails and I think it would be a good way to learn and get myself more involved with Go by writing a similar API in Go.

Let the adventure begin!
